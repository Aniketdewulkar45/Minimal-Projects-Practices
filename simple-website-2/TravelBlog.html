 <center><h2>MIND BLOWING SHIBUYA CROSSING</h2>
</center>
<center><p>On my trip to japan i discovered What makes Shibuya Crossing unique? Unlike typical intersections where pedestrians cross one direction at a time, Shibuya Crossing is known for its scramble style. All traffic stops, allowing people to cross diagonally and from all sides at once in a visually chaotic, yet organized, flow of people.<blockquote>"Travel expands the mind"</blockquote>Shibuya is famous for the iconic and busy Shibuya Scramble Crossing, its status as Tokyo's youth and fashion hub, vibrant shopping and dining, trend-setting culture, and lively nightlife.</p></center>
